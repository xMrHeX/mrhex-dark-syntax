# MrHeX Dark Syntax theme

Atom theme using the ever popular dark [MrHeX]() colors.

I like dark windows and lots of bright colored text that pops out at you.
Best with [MrHeX Dark UI](https://github.com/xMrHeX/mrhex-dark-ui)

I used [one-dark-syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) as a template and went from there.
I added json syntax support with help from [akofman/json-colorer](https://github.com/akofman/json-colorer) plugin. Thanks!
This theme can be activated by going to the _Themes_ section
in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_Syntax Themes_ dropdown menu.
